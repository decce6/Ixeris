         * Thread from using too much processing power. It has the added benefit that, because glfwSwapBuffers() mostly
         * involves work done on the GPU, the CPU is quite idle here so event polling wouldn't battle with rendering,
         * even on machines with few CPU cores.
         *
         * The only potential issue here is that, if glfwPollEvents() take longer to finish than glfwSwapBuffers(),
         * input can be lagged by up to 1 frame. This is very unlikely, from my observations. Nevertheless, a config
         * option is provided for those who don't care about Event Polling Thread taking up a lot of CPU power.
